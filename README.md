This is built on [Victor Hugo](https://github.com/netlify/victor-hugo) boilerplate for using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) as a static site generator and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) + [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) as our asset pipeline. It is set up to use [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for CSS and JavaScript compiling/transpiling.

See [Victor Hugo README](https://github.com/netlify/victor-hugo/blob/master/README.md) for usage instructions.
