Our open house is going virtual this year! So, we need you to sign-up by following the link below. The open house will include an overview of our FIRSTÂ® Robotics Competition (FRC) program with a Q & A session. All students in grades 9-12 from the Greater Kalamazoo area are welcome, and no previous experience is required. Currently, we are actively recruiting for our high school program, FRC. 

Although, we are not recruiting 5-8 grade students at this time, please feel free to sign-up for more information, and you will be contacted prior to the start of those seasons. Next Robotics Generation (NRG), the 5th and 6th grade program, is in session now and the VEX IQ program for 7th and 8th grade is postponed until Spring 2021 due to COVID-19.

Our open house will utilize Zoom. We will send the Zoom meeting invitation to the email address you provide. If you cannot join live, please still sign-up, so we can reach out to you with further information.

# Our Teams

Stryke Force has three different robotics programs: NRG (grades 5-6), VEX IQ Robotics (grades 7-8), and FRC (grades 9-12).

## FIRST Robotics Competition

FRC challenges our high-school students to raise funds, market our brand, hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game against other teams from Michigan and around the world. This season, we are continuing last year's game: **Infinite Recharge**!

Our team is divided into 3 major sub-teams: engineering, programming, and business. Students can explore in our space going from welding to scouting to marketing to driving to industrial designing, and so on. We encourage our members to make their own path utilizing our exquisite mentors and the badge system.
- The engineering team works to build and design the robot for the season's game.
- The programming team works to program the robot to complete tasks and to create the scouting app for the season's game.
- The business team works to gain sponsors, create/run outreach events, and apply for team awards.

## Next Robotics Generation

{{< youtube VbYttJtLK5k >}}

NRG uses **Arduino** robot kits to get fully functioning robots in the hands of kids (and parents) quickly. The robots you build, and compete with, are yours to take home and enjoy.

First year students will work with a parent to build an Arduino robot car, learn how to upload programs to their robot, and compete in a simple but challenging game. Second year students will build on the experiences and robot they gained last season with a game that includes an autonomous portion.

## Vex IQ

{{< youtube ihk1KUI3duU >}}

VEX IQ is a programmable, snap-together, robotics system. In teams of 3, students build their robot to compete in the annual VEX IQ challenge. Following the fun, yet challenging curriculum, students learn skills in engineering, programming, and presentation.
