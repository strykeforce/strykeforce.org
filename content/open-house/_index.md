Mark your calendars for the upcoming Stryke Force Open House! Our open house is going virtual this year, which means we need you to RSVP. The open house will be on TBD @ this TIME. Everyone is welcome! We will be discussing our three different programs, and inviting prospective students to join!

Our open house will utilize Zoom. If you do not have the ability to join us live, don't worry! We will be sending out the same information afterwards. So, if you cannot join live, please still RSVP below so we can make sure to reach you.

# Our Teams

Stryke Force has three different robotics programs: Next Robotics Generation (grades 5-6), VEX IQ Robotics (grades 7-8), and FIRST Robotics Competition (grades 9-12).

## Next Robotics Generation

{{< youtube VbYttJtLK5k >}}

Next Robotics Generation uses **Arduino** robot kits to get fully functioning robots in the hands of kids (and parents) quickly. The robots you build, and compete with, are yours to take home and enjoy.

First year students will work with a parent to build an Arduino robot car, learn how to upload programs to their robot, and compete in a simple but challenging game. Second year students will build on the experiences and robot they gained last season with a game that includes an autonomous portion.

## Vex IQ

VEX IQ is a programmable, snap-together, robotics system. In teams of 3, students build their robot to compete in the annual VEX IQ challenge. Following the fun, yet challenging curriculum, students learn skills in engineering, programming, and presentation. 

Unfortunately, our 2020 VEX IQ season has been cancelled due to COVID-19. However, we are diligently working on a new curriculum to incorporate our VEX IQ team with our Next Robotics Generation and our FIRST Robotics Competition this season.

## FIRST Robotics Competition

![FRC 2018 Team Picture](frc_2018_worlds.jpg 'Our world winning team in 2018.')

FIRSTÂ® Robotics Competition challenges our high-school students to raise funds, market our brand, hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game against other teams from Michigan and around the world. This season, we are continuing last year's game: **Infinite Recharge**!

Our team is divided into 5 major sub-teams: engineering, programming, and business. Students can explore in our space going from welding to scouting to marketing to driving to industrial designing, and so on. We encourage our members to make their own path utilizing our exquisite mentors and the badge system.
