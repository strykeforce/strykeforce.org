Stryke Force is about more than building robots, we are also passionate about building our community. We do our best to establish connections with people throughout Kalamazoo, lending a helping hand and inspiring others with our actions. Team members volunteer at a variety of events to promote STEM, give back to the community, and help people of all ages. Our mission is to share our love for robotics with the entire area.

The Talons Out Honor Flight program raises money to send World War II, Korean, and Vietnam veterans to visit their monuments in Washington D.C. After a full day of recognition and gratitude for the veterans, the veterans are welcomed home by the entire community, and Stryke Force students honor America's veterans by facilitating a welcome-home parade and celebration.

## Growler's Education Day

Our annual open houses always draw a large crowd. The attendees of this fun exhibition of the team include prospective students, local government representatives, partners, and potential partners, other _FIRST_ teams, or anyone who just wants to check us out. Stryke Force engages everyone with tours, stations, and demonstrations. It's a great way to get our community excited about the program and share tips and advice with other teams.

## Government Representatives
