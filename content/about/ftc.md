Special Air Services, Team 7228, had their Rookie year in 2013.  Due to the tremendous growth in interest in our program, Team 8553, the Screaming Eagles, was added a year later.

Each season our students are tasked with designing, building and programming a new robot to compete in the current year's game, according to specifications set by the FIRST program.  Robots are required to fit into an 18 inch by 18 inch box in the starting position.  We are eagerly awaiting the reveal of this year's game, Rover Ruckus, which will be unveiled on September 8th, 2018.
