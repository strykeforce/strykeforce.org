Team 2767, **Stryke Force** is a community [_FIRST<sup>®</sup>_ Robotics Competition](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) team based in Kalamazoo, Michigan. We are FRC 2767, FTC 7228, FTC 8553 and FTC 15106.

As a _FIRST_ Robotics Competition team, Stryke Force annually challenges our high-school students to raise funds, market our brand, hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game against other teams from Michigan and around the world.

Each season's unique game requires a new robot to be built and programmed under strict rules, limited resources, and an intense six week time limit. It’s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team. Each season ends with an exciting [_FIRST_ Championship](https://www.firstchampionship.org).
