Our team was able to present to the entire board about the importance of _FIRST_ not only on the team members but also in Kalamazoo County. Later both teams had a meet and greet with various other members of the Michigan Department of Education to talk about increased implementation of _FIRST_ directly into the school systems.

After an hour of interaction and brainstorming, 2767 was off to the State Capitol to meet with legislators, where students had the opportunity to briefly meet with Representative Brandt Iden.

The team would like to thank the Michigan Board of Education for the opportunity to present and advocate for further state support of the FIRST Robotics program.
