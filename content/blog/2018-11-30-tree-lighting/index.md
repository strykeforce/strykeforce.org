Last Friday, at Bronson Park in downtown Kalamazoo, the annual tree lighting ceremony drew numerous spectators and families — Stryke Force families and their children, among them — to a plethora of attractions not limited to live music, a visit from Santa Claus, and holiday food.

Stryke Force students and their families were able to get into their holiday helping mood by volunteering to serve hot chocolate, guard ice sculptures, and man arts/crafts stations. 

According to MLive, over 3,000 onlookers attended; in attendance was Kalamazoo Mayor Bobby Hopewell and many other city commissioners, who flipped the switch to power on all of the Christmas lights and decorations before the crowd. In conclusion, it was a great day for some members of the team to participate in.
