Happy Holidays from all of the students, families, and mentors of Stryke Force!

<!--more-->

Our usual meetings on Tuesdays and Thursdays at our new build space at 3710 Gembrit Circle will briefly pause after this week, only to start again after Christmas and New Yearâ€™s Day, on the Thursday of January 2. With this holiday break coming up, we are only closer to the FIRST Kickoff that will occur on January 4, where the objective of the upcoming FIRST season will be revealed to the world for the first time.
