As a rookie my experience has been great so far. The atmosphere is great, the mentors are always ready to help and give input, and the students are energetic and willing to learn and build their knowledge of engineering. If I need some help with something merely asking for help is all I need to do to have someone jump in a give assistance. Everyone is really friendly and and actually wants to be a part of the team.

Having multiple parts to the program is a huge help. Whether I want to do programming, machining/ building or deal with the business side of things thereâ€™s a area where I can do all these things. The freedom to choose what path you want to go down allows freedom for growth and development of your skills. Over all the team has a great group of students and leaders alike who are willing to work as a team to overcome obstacles and achieve goals.
