The Blue Alliance—unquestionably the leading website for team information, match videos, and results pertaining to FIRST Robotics competitions—has recently unveiled an app for iOS.

<!--more-->

Like the website, the Blue Alliance app contains a plethora of data about all things FIRST, including match breakdowns, and event and team statistics. You can also watch archived videos and team media, and follow team and event socials right from the app. It is most likely an anticipated move for the website, which has had an app for Android devices on the Google Play Store.

For Stryke Force students, family, and friends that have iOS devices, catch up on FIRST by downloading the app from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id1441973916?mt=8).
