In mid July, Stryke Force attended the Indiana Robotics Invitational (IRI). IRI
invites the best-of-the-best teams to compete in the offseason.

This year, 68 teams attended the event from all over the US and Canada with a
few teams from Israel, Mexico, and New Zealand. Not only was IRI a robotics
competition, it was also a fundraising charity event, as the money raised went
to support Team 4418 Impulse in honor of Kendrick Castillo. Stryke Force faced
some fierce competition; going into quarter finals, we were the first pick of
Alliance 2, and made it to the finals with a playoff record of 4-3-0. Stryke
Force will continue its offseason tour by attending the Mid Mitten Robo Rodeo,
FSU Robotics Competition, and the West Michigan Robotics Invitational where we
will continue to hone our skills and give our newest team members competition
experience.

My experience during IRI was one of learning. I spent the majority of the
competition weekend in the pit learning from the mentors and older members of
the team on how the pit runs and how we fix the robot on the fly. I answered
questions people had about the robot and the team, and I was able to help fix
the robot on a few occasions, such as having to use a screwdriver to pull
carpet pieces out of the wheels. I feel that this experience has helped me to
progress to where I want to be in the future on the team.
