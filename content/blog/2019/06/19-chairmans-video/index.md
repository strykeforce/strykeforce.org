According to FIRST’s website, "the Chairman’s Award is the most prestigious award at FIRST, and it honors the team that best represents a model for other teams to emulate and best embodies the mission of FIRST. It was created to keep the central focus of FIRST Robotics Competition on the ultimate goal of transforming the culture in ways that will inspire greater levels of respect and honor for science and technology, as well as encouraging more of today’s youth to become science and technology leaders." Our team worked hard to prepare for this award, and the group presented at the St. Joe and Kentwood competitions during the season.

Along with the presentation, our Stryke Force students have worked diligently with preparing and filming a required video to submit for the award, and we want everyone to see it! And thank you to Skye for assisting in the production of the video. The video is above, and here are a few photos showing the behind the scenes of the filming.
