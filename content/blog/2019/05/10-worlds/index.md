Last month, the best teams of the world—bringing more than 40,000 people, and from 70+ countries—descended upon Detroit for the FIRST Robotics Championship. With great expectations of us coming from our status as back-to-back world champions, we advanced to the finals and finished there with a record of 14-2-0. Competing against 136 teams for 8 awards, Stryke Force also received the Excellence in Engineering Award, for an outstanding design and the ability of our students to explain the iteration and concepts linked to the design.

Although the amazing experience of World's is over, the off-season is just starting. The team will soon be starting to discuss lessons learned and how to move forward, and holding a mentor retirement party, Community Open Houses, and other community-based events.

We work to show our best on the world stage each year. It is a long process and as students we could not do it alone. We would like to take a moment and thank our mentors and parents who fed us, encouraged us, corrected us, drove us and helped make us better people. We would also like to thank our sponsors. Without your generous support we would not be able to accomplish all of the things we dream about.

Go Stryke Force!
