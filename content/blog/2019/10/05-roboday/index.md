We ranked third and then teamed up with Team 2054: Tech Vikes, and Team 6005: Cardinaltronics. We had a few mechanical errors along the way, but in the end it was not only valuable learning experience before the actual competition season, but also a fun and successful day. Students were even able to take a tour of the university before alliance selection and elimination rounds started.

Off-season events are an incredibly impactful experience for new members and returning members alike, as it offers less competitive involvement but equally realistic matches for practice. Our next off-season events will be the Grand Rapids Girls Competition, and the West Michigan Robotics Invitational. Please attend!
