This past weekend at Saginaw Valley State University in Saginaw, Michigan, Team 2767 Stryke Force competed with the best FIRST robotics teams in the entire state (Michigan also has the most FIRST Robotics teams in the country, at 542!). We finished in the semifinals, at Rank 3, with a record of 15-4-0 that came with the 210 total points we earned. Our team now ranks 6th in the state, and as the Division Championship Winner, the team also earned the Quality Award sponsored by Motorola Solutions Foundation. Of course, we couldn't have done this without our sponsors!
