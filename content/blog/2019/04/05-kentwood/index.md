This past weekend at East Kentwood High School up near Grand Rapids, Stryke Force participated in our second competition with great success! Over the course of the two days of competing, Team 2767 finished in the Finals, cementing our position as a District Event Finalist in a tight-scoring last two matches. The team finished in Rank 2, with a record of 14-4-0. In addition to the robotics side of competition, the team also earned the Entrepreneurship Award sponsored by Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers.
