This holiday season, Stryke Force is proud to help student Samuel R. collect winter wear for the Kalamazoo Gospel Mission. Samuel is a member of the National Honors Society chapter at Comstock High School. Every year, the chapter hosts Warm Up the Winter, an event where local businesses and organizations collect new gloves, hats, coats, and other winter wear. Items are collected in a large, holiday-themed box at every participating location.
