Stryke Force continued our annual tradition of welcoming home local veterans from their day at several memorials in our nationâ€™s capital. Every year, Stryke Force pairs with the volunteers from the Air Zoo and other various programs to make the trip back as welcoming and comfortable as we can. This year, Stryke Force was tasked with helping to keep the atmosphere of the event light, and to ensure the overall safety of the public. With the help of the people there, we were able to successfully make the night a warm and impactful one for everyone.

Stryke Force is grateful for the opportunity to be able to thank and recognize our veterans for their service. It is a truly heartwarming experience when we get to see families reuniting, old friends catching up, and bonding over their experiences. There is nothing that can compare to that sense of accomplishment Stryke Force feels leaving the Air Zoo knowing that we are able to give back to the community.
