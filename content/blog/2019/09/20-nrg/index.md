With the high school FRC team kicking off their official team meetings the Thursday of September 5, a new kind of energy has enveloped our build space at Midlink. This is also largely in part of NRG—the Next Robotics Generation, our youngest age group with students from 5th and 6th grades—starting its season.

Our NRG team this year has over 40 eager students. They are supported by the amazing dedication of 10 mentors, all Stryker employees, who guide the students and their parents through the building of an Arduino robot car, the uploading of programs to it, and the competition the robots take part in at the end. And students will be able to take home their hand-built car, making it a satisfying trophy evident of their efforts!
