This past weekend Stryke Force participated in a great opportunity to serve our community, and our veterans.

Together with the wonderful volunteers from Talons Out Honor Flight, students on Stryke Force lent a helping hand by helping set up the parade route and pushing wheelchairs of the veterans who required them. Many of the veterans were brought to tears as they meet the crowds of people there to thank them for their service and welcome them home. Powerful events like this remind us here at Stryke Force what a privilege it is to be part of the Portage/Kalamazoo community.
