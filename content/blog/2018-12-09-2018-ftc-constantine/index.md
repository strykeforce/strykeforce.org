Our 3 FTC teams had a great time at the Constantine Qualifier on November 17th. It was the debut competition for our newest team, the Spittin' Kittens. Team 7228 finished third in qualifiers, but was knocked out in semi-finals. The students came away with a positive attitude and a list of ideas of how to improve their robot for next time.
