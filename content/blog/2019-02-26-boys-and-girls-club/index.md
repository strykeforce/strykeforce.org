Interacting with the community on behalf of the team is always fun, but the Boys and Girls club takes it to the next level.

Before I got to meet the children participating in the program I was pretty nervous. I really had no need to be though. Everyone was very nice and hospitable, they were also excited about the robots. The entire room was just filled with an intuitive and kind atmosphere. Not only were the kids excited about building the robots, but they had a lot of natural talent and strong determination that made them perfect for the program.

The first meeting was just about taking inventory, as well as discussing robotics, and how it can apply to everyday life. The second meeting the children got pretty far with building the base of the robots. I hope that the children, in the future will not only gain knowledge from this experience but choose to pursue more options like this in the future.

All in all, I had a lot of fun with the kids and I have very high hopes for them.
