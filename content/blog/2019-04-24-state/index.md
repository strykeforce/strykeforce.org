This past weekend at Saginaw Valley State University in Saginaw, Michigan, Team
2767 Stryke Force competed with the best FIRST robotics teams in the entire
state (Michigan also has the most FIRST Robotics teams in the country, at
542!). We finished in the semifinals, at Rank 3, with a record of 15-4-0 that
came with the 210 total points we earned. Our team now ranks 6th in the state,
and as the Division Championship Winner, the team also earned the Quality Award
sponsored by Motorola Solutions Foundation. Of course, we couldn't have done
this without our sponsors!
