The YouTube video above shows a very helpful animation that will give a general overview of the match. In Destination: Deep Space, two competing alliances attempt to use their robots to collect as much cargo as possible, before the next sandstorm arrives. After a 15 second sandstorm  with limited driver visibility, teams control their robots to prepare rockets and cargo ships with hatch panels, and then load them up with cargo pods. Teams then attempt to make it back to the habitat they started from, and of course, whichever alliance with the highest score at the end of the match wins!

The official [Game & Season Manual](https://firstfrc.blob.core.windows.net/frc2019/Manual/2019FRCGameSeasonManual.pdf "Game & Season Manual") provides all the details for those interested in an in-depth understanding of the game. More information, such as game logos and other resources, is available online at [firstinspires.org](https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc/game-and-season/ "First Inspires").
