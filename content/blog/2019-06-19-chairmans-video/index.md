According to FIRST’s website, "the Chairman’s Award is the most prestigious
award at FIRST, and it honors the team that best represents a model for other
teams to emulate and best embodies the mission of FIRST. It was created to keep
the central focus of FIRST Robotics Competition on the ultimate goal of
transforming the culture in ways that will inspire greater levels of respect
and honor for science and technology, as well as encouraging more of today’s
youth to become science and technology leaders." Our team worked hard to
prepare for this award, and the group presented at the St. Joe and Kentwood
competitions during the season.

Along with the presentation, our Stryke Force students have worked diligently
with preparing and filming a required video to submit for the award, and we
want everyone to see it! And thank you to Skye for assisting in the production
of the video. The video is above, and here are a few photos showing the behind
