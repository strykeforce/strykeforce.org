Pop Cans Piling up? Donate Them and Support Stryke Force!

<!--more-->

Although we are sad the season ended abruptly, we are starting to look forward to next year. To make the upcoming season as great as possible, we are looking for ways to raise money.  Since I have been a part of Stryke Force we have always done Pop Can Drives, but this year is a little different. Safety is our top priority, so instead of going door to door we are asking that the returnable cans and bottles be dropped off at our building.  Empty returnables can be placed in plastic garbage bags and left outside under the covered area any day before 5pm.  Please share this information with family and friends.  Thank you for supporting our team, and be on the lookout for info on our upcoming Virtual Open House!
