Here on the business team, we are rearing up for competitions. For us, that means submitting and presenting for awards. The Big Kahuna is always the Chairman's award. As you may or may not know, the Chairman's award for FIRST robotics requires a one to three minute video giving an overview of everything that makes your team an awesome one.

This year, our video comprised of interviews with a variety of different Stryke Force participants, which included both our middle and high school teams, footage from past years, and, most importantly, an overlying theme. That theme is, "May The Stryke Force Be With You!" (We're really playing off of the Star Wars: Rise for Change campaign!)

Filming this year's video was particularly exciting because we had the chance to learn a bit about film production from one of our mentors. We learned how to create a setting, which includes a background, middleground, and foreground. For our 2020 video, we used our pit facade as our background, the interviewee as the middleground, and a table with some Star Wars props as our foreground. Another exciting thing we learned is organization and editing. We took about thirty minutes of footage for just the interviews! So, we had to find a way to cut it all down by organizing what pieces of footage we wanted from each take and deciding on the transitions that would fit the best.

It's simple to say that the business team had a lot of fun working on this project. Watch out for the 2020 Chairman's Video that will be released on our youtube channel shortly!
