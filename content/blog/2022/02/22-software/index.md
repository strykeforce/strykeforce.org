The software team is hard at work! Want to learn more about what they’re learning?

<!--more-->

The software team mentors teach the students about code in fun and interactive ways. Miles F., a Portage Northern freshman on the programming team, says he is learning about different ways code makes the robot run.  Currently, the software programming students are creating subsystems, autonomous/path developments, and the robot's vision system. Miles has been spending his time on creating intake and magazine code, as well as testing autonomous paths. We look forward to seeing their coding in action at our first competition on March 11th and 12th at St. Joseph High School!
