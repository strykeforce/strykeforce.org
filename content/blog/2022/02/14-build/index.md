Learn how the Stryke Force build team jumped into the 2022 season.

<!--more-->
The build team has made a lot of progress already this season! Currently, they are working on disassembling Stryke Force’s previous robot and prototyping the new robot for the 2022 season. Peter R., a Sturgis homeschooled junior from Sturgis, says he enjoys the build team because this team allows him to learn new skills, work with other team members, and “strengthen my values as an individual.” Because many of the build team members are new to Stryke Force this year, there are plenty of learning opportunities and ways for new people to participate. Watch Stryke Force’s robot in action on March 11th and 12th at St. Joseph High School, and again on March 31st at Lakeview High School.
