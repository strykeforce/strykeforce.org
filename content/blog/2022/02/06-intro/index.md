After the abrupt end to our 2020 season, our team is finally back in action and busy at work.

Stryke Force FRC has 33 students from 11 different schools and home schools. For the past month we have been focusing on this year’s game called Rapid React. Robots will work to put “cargo” into either a lower or an upper hub to score points. Robots can also earn more points by climbing rungs of a ladder during the last thirty seconds of the match. During the autonomous period, while the robot is executing the program written beforehand, the human player will have a chance to shoot cargo into the hub for more points. We are super excited for our first competition, March 10th through 12th, at St. Joseph High School.
