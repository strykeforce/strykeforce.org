Stryke Force is back!

Our FRC team is currently made up of  33 students from 11 different schools and home schools. The game this year is called “Rapid React.” Robots will work to put “cargo” into either a lower or an upper hub to score points. Robots can also earn more points by climbing rungs of a ladder during the last thirty seconds of the match. During the autonomous period, while the robot is executing the program written beforehand, the human player will have a chance to shoot cargo into the hub for more points. We are super excited for our first competition, March 10 through 12, at St. Joseph High School.
