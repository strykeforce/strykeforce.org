The business team has accomplished so much already this season. Want to hear about what we are currently working on?

Lizzy R., a freshman at Portage Northern High School, says she loves being a part of the Stryke Force business team because the team allows her to work on so many different projects. Lizzy also likes being able to have fun, laugh, and talk while we work. Currently, the team is spending time communicating with sponsors, finishing the business plan, designing team awards, and picking out giveaways for competitions. Lizzyâ€™s personal role on the team is writing the business plan and the business plan summary to submit for the Entrepreneurship Award. We hope to see you in St. Joe on March 11th and 12th!
