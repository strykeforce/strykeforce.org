Stryke Force brings home their first blue banner of 2022!

<!--more-->

We are so excited that Stryke Force won our first competition last weekend! We took first place at the St. Joe District event with our alliance partners, Team 4003 TriSonics from Allendale and Team 3452 GreengineerZ from Berrien Springs.  In addition, Stryke Force won the 2022 Autonomous Award.  All Stryke Force team members played a very important role in making this competition a success and helping to bring home the blue banner. Thank you to our sponsors for contributing to our success.  We are busy making improvements as we look forward to our next competition. We hope to see you at Lakeview High School on April 1st and 2nd!
