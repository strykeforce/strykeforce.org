The scouting team is hard at work preparing for the St. Joe event!

<!--more-->

Cole S., the leader of the scouting team, has been on the Stryke Force team for four years. Cole loves the fact that the scouting team allows him to work directly with the game and watch “match after match with a purpose”. Being able to see all of his hard work pay off is another aspect of the scouting team that Cole loves. Currently, the scouting team is working on finalizing an app for our upcoming competition in St. Joe and preparing for a training day. Cole’s personal role on the team on competition day is taking detailed notes about other teams to effectively pick a team to work with later in the competition. We are super excited to see you next week on March 11th and 12th in St. Joe!
