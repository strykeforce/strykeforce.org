Learn more about what the drive team is working on after our first competition!

<!--more-->

All of the Stryke Force team is hard at work to prepare for our next competition. Tori D., one of the main drivers on the drive team, shared that the drive team has been spending time reviewing matches from the St. Joe competition to talk about areas where we can improve. Tori says one of her favorite parts of being on the drive team is meeting other teams and watching different robot/game strategies at the competitions. Come watch our robot compete again at Lakeview High School on April 1st and April 2nd!
