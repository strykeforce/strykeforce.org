In the past few weeks, Stryke Force's 7th and 8th grade VEX IQ teams have been hard at work developing new skills.

One of our lead mentor Zac says "seeing the kids work together and problem solve" is his favorite part of this program. We asked the kids what their favorite parts of being a part of the team are and answers ranged from "candy" to "being able to drive the robot"; Some even said that they just "enjoy learning fun stuff, unlike school." Overall, Stryke Force is very happy about this year's turnout for the VEX program and we are very excited to host our in-house competition on November 19th.
