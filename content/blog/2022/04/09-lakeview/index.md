Stryke Force brought home our second blue banner of the season!

<!--more-->

We are so excited to share that Stryke Force won a second district competition last weekend at Lakeview High School! Helping us bring home our second blue banner of the season were our alliance partners, Team 1188 Robo Ravens from Royal Oak and Team 1940 Tech Tigers from Benton Harbor! In addition, Stryke Force was also awarded with the Team Spirit Award. We were so excited to show off our robot to one of our sponsors and have their family join us for lunch and help cheer on our team.

Stryke Force is currently working diligently to improve our robot in preparation for the state competition at Saginaw Valley State University. We would like to give a special shoutout to all of our sponsors for helping make our last competition a success. We hope to see you in Saginaw to watch Stryke Force compete at the FIRST in Michigan State Competition on April 14th through April 16th!
