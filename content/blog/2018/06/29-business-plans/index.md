While the build group starts their weekly meetings, our business members are in full swing! We have lots of things that we're all excited about this summer as the business side works the whole year.

One of these is the student ambassador program. Although still in its infancy, I truly believe that this will foster growth that is pertinent to helping maintain partnerships with local businesses that are imperative to the function of the team. This group of students like me will have a personal connection with each business they are assigned to, thus being able to communicate more effectively, in an ambassador-like manner. I can't wait to see what it will become of in the coming months!

The business team will also be taking ownership of the Stryke Force website that you're reading right now. All the content, including these blogs, and the introduction of new pages, will be done by us. And speaking of blogs, they'll be churning out every week based on our new plan, so stay tuned!
