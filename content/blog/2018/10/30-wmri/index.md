WMRI went great, we started out a little rusty but we picked up the pace and worked out the kinks to be the first alliance captain. After alliance selections, we then went on to play some tough finals matches, winning the rubber match against the third seed. The rest of the day went smoothly, the pit was packed up with lots of help from the team.
