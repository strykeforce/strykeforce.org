You may have seen them in your neighborhood collecting pop cans. They have been working hard and have collected over 15,000 cans so far, which is about half way to their goal. The next pop can drive will be on September 6th. Cans and bottles will also be collected at Midlink for the remainder of the season.

The kids have met a lot of wonderful people (and pets!) along the way and would like to thank everyone who donated to our team.
