Exactly half a century after Apollo 11 launched and brought astronauts to the moon, FIRST will commemorate the innovation of interstellar travel by having this year’s theme being space related. The live-stream will let viewers have their first glimpse of the field, and get a look at game play details. For viewers at home, you can [watch Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/firstinspires) for the official game reveal, which will be broadcasting live from Manchester, New Hampshire.
