For another year, everyone on Stryke Force that participated in Prairie Ridge Elementary School’s annual STEAM Night—middle school students, high school students, and adult mentors of our team—had an equally fun and rewarding time.

Prairie Ridge Elementary School’s STEAM Night allowed elementary school students and their families to have a fun time learning and exploring different concepts of science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics by engaging in hands-on activities with a group of vendors, including our partners Stryker and Pfizer. As one of the vendors, Stryke Force’s area had a display of our team’s trophies and medals, special giveaways, and a space for interested children to drive VEX IQ and NRG robots.

Thank you for all of those on our team who volunteered! We all saw the smiling faces of the kids when they played with the robots, and we can all take pride in saying that through robotics, we made their day educational and fun! 
Stryke Force is helping students receive education in new and different ways, helping them prepare for the future.
